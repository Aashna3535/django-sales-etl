# django-sales-etl
This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Django. It extracts data from various sources, applies transformations, and loads the cleaned data into a database for further analysis or use in other applications. The goal is to automate the data processing pipeline for seamless data integration and analysis.
